# Sort Index Query Results

---

{NOTE: }

* This article provides examples of sorting query results when querying a static-index.  

* **Prior to this article**, please refer to [Sort dynamic queries results](../../client-api/session/querying/sort-query-results) for dynamic-queries examples  
  and general knowledge about Sorting.

* All sorting capabilities provided for a dynamic query can also be used when querying a static-index.

* In this page:
    * [Order by index-field value](../../indexes/querying/sorting#order-by-index-field-value)  
    * [Order results when index-field is searchable](../../indexes/querying/sorting#order-results-when-index-field-is-searchable)  
    * [Additional Sorting Options](../../indexes/querying/sorting#additional-sorting-options)

{PANEL: Order by index-field value}

Use `orderByDescending` to order the results by the specified index-field.

{CODE-TABS}
{CODE-TAB:php:Query sort_1@Indexes\Querying\Sorting.php /}
{CODE-TAB:php:documentQuery sort_3@Indexes\Querying\Sorting.php /}
{CODE-TAB:php:Index index_1@Indexes\Querying\Sorting.php /}
{CODE-TAB-BLOCK:sql:RQL}
from index "Products/ByUnitsInStock"
where UnitsInStock > 10
order by UnitsInStock as long desc
{CODE-TAB-BLOCK/}
{CODE-TABS/}

{INFO: }

**Ordering Type**:

* By default, `orderByDescending` will determine the `OrderingType` from the property path expression  
  and specify that ordering type in the generated RQL that is sent to the server.

* E.g., in the above example, ordering by `UnitsInStock` will result in `OrderingType::int`
  because that property data type is an integer.

* Different ordering can be forced.  
  See section [Force ordering type](../../client-api/session/querying/sort-query-results#force-ordering-type) 
  for all available ordering types.  
  The same syntax used with dynamic queries also applies to queries made on indexes.

{PANEL: Order results when index-field is searchable}

* **When configuring an index-field** for [full-text search](../../indexes/querying/searching), 
  the content of the index-field is broken down into terms at indexing time. 
  The specific tokenization depends on the [analyzer](../../indexes/using-analyzers) used.

* **When querying such index**, if you order by that searchable index-field, 
  results will come back sorted based on the terms, and not based on the original text of the field.
  
* To overcome this, you can define another index-field that is not searchable and sort by it. 

{CODE-TABS}
{CODE-TAB:php:Index index_2@Indexes\Querying\Sorting.php /}
{CODE-TAB:php:Query sort_4@Indexes\Querying\Sorting.php /}
{CODE-TAB:php:documentQuery sort_6@Indexes\Querying\Sorting.php /}
{CODE-TAB-BLOCK:sql:RQL}
from index "Products/BySearchName" 
where search(Name, "ch*")
order by NameForSorting
{CODE-TAB-BLOCK/}
{CODE-TABS/}

{PANEL: Additional sorting options}

* When querying an index, the following sorting options are the **same** as when making a dynamic query.

* Refer to the examples in the links below to see how each option is achieved.

  * [Order by score](../../client-api/session/querying/sort-query-results#order-by-score)

  * [Order by random](../../client-api/session/querying/sort-query-results#order-by-random)

  * [Order by spatial](../../client-api/session/querying/sort-query-results#order-by-spatial)

  * [Chain ordering](../../client-api/session/querying/sort-query-results#chain-ordering)

  * [Custom sorters](../../client-api/session/querying/sort-query-results#custom-sorters)
