# Indexes: Boosting
---

{NOTE: }

* When querying with some filtering conditions, a basic **score** is 
  calculated by the underlying engine for each document in the results.  

* Providing a **boost value** to selected fields allows prioritization of the resulting documents.  
  The boos value is integrated with the basic score, increasing the document rank.  

* The automatic ordering of results by their score is [configurable](../indexes/boosting#automatic-score-based-ordering).  

* Boosting can be achieved in the following ways:

    * **At query time**:  
      By applying a boost factor to searched terms at query time (see [Boost search results](../client-api/session/querying/text-search/boost-search-results)).  

    * **Via index definition**:  
      By applying a boost factor in the index definition, as described in this article.  
 
* In this page:
    * [Assign a boost factor to an index-field](../indexes/boosting#assign-a-boost-factor-to-an-index-field)
    * [Assign a boost factor to the index-entry](../indexes/boosting#assign-a-boost-factor-to-the-index-entry)
    * [Automatic score-based ordering](../indexes/boosting#automatic-score-based-ordering)

Applying a boost value to an index-field allows prioritization of matching documents based on an index-field.

##### The index:

{CODE-TABS}
{CODE-TAB:php:LINQ_index index_1@Indexes\Boosting.php /}
{CODE-TAB:php:JavaScript_index index_1_js@Indexes\Boosting.php /}
{CODE-TABS/}

##### The query:

{CODE-TABS}
{CODE-TAB:php:Query query_1@Indexes\Boosting.php /}
{CODE-TAB:php:DocumentQuery query_3@Indexes\Boosting.php /}
{CODE-TAB-BLOCK:sql:RQL}

{PANEL: Assign a boost factor to the index-entry}

Applying a boost value to the whole index-entry allows prioritization of matching documents by content from the document.

{CODE-TABS}
{CODE-TAB:php:LINQ_index index_2@Indexes\Boosting.php /}
{CODE-TAB:php:JavaScript_index index_2_js@Indexes\Boosting.php /}
{CODE-TABS/}

##### The query:

{CODE-TABS}
{CODE-TAB:php:Query query_4@Indexes\Boosting.php /}
{CODE-TAB:php:DocumentQuery query_6@Indexes\Boosting.php /}
{CODE-TAB-BLOCK:sql:RQL}

{PANEL: Automatic score-based ordering}

* By default, whenever boosting is applied, either via dynamic querying or when querying an index 
  that has a boosting factor in its definition, the results will be automatically ordered by the score.  

* This behavior can be modified using the [OrderByScoreAutomaticallyWhenBoostingIsInvolved](../server/configuration/indexing-configuration#indexing.orderbyscoreautomaticallywhenboostingisinvolved)  
  configuration key.  

* Refer to the [Get resulting score](../client-api/session/querying/sort-query-results#get-resulting-score) 
  section to learn how to retrieve the calculated score of each result.
