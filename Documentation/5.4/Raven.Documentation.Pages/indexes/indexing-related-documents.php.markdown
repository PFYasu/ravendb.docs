# Indexes: Indexing Related Documents
---

{NOTE: }

* As described in [modeling considerations in RavenDB](https://ravendb.net/learn/inside-ravendb-book/reader/4.0/3-document-modeling#summary),  
  it is recommended for documents to be: independent, isolated, and coherent.  
  However, to accommodate varied models, **documents can reference other documents**.  

* The related data from a referenced (related) document can be indexed,  
  this will allow querying the collection by the indexed related data.

* The related documents that are loaded in the index definition can be either **Tracked** or **Not-Tracked**.

{PANEL: What are related documents}

* Whenever a document references another document, the referenced document is called a **Related Document**.  

* In the image below, document `products/34-A` references documents `categories/1-A` & `suppliers/16-A`,  
  which are considered Related Documents.

{PANEL: Index related documents - With tracking}

### Example I - basic

* **What is tracked**:  
  Both the documents from the **indexed collection** and the **indexed related documents** are tracked for changes.  
  Re-indexing will be triggered per any change in either collection.  
  (See changes that cause re-indexing [here](../indexes/indexing-related-documents#document-changes-that-cause-re-indexing)).

* **The index**:  
  Following the above `Product - Category` relationship from the Northwind sample database,  
  an index defined on the Products collection can index data from the related Category document.

     {CODE-TABS}
     {CODE-TAB:php:LINQ-index indexing_related_documents_1@Indexes\IndexingRelatedDocuments.php /}
     {CODE-TAB:php:JavaScript-index indexing_related_documents_1_JS@Indexes\IndexingRelatedDocuments.php /}
     {CODE-TABS/}

* **The query**:  
  We can now query the index for Product documents by `CategoryName`,  
  i.e. get all matching Products that reference a Category that has the specified name term.

     {CODE-TABS}
     {CODE-TAB:php:Query indexing_related_documents_2@Indexes\IndexingRelatedDocuments.php /}
     {CODE-TAB-BLOCK:sql:RQL}
     from index "Products/ByCategoryName"
where CategoryName == "Beverages"
     {CODE-TAB-BLOCK/}
     {CODE-TABS/}

---

### Example II - list

* **The documents**:  
  {CODE:php indexing_related_documents_3@Indexes\IndexingRelatedDocuments.php /}

* **The index**:  
  This index will index all names of the related Book documents.

     {CODE-TABS}
     {CODE-TAB:php:LINQ-index indexing_related_documents_4@Indexes\IndexingRelatedDocuments.php /}
     {CODE-TAB:php:JavaScript-index indexing_related_documents_4_JS@Indexes\IndexingRelatedDocuments.php /}
     {CODE-TABS/}
     
* **The query**:  
  We can now query the index for Author documents by a book's name,  
  i.e. get all Authors that have the specified book's name in their list.
  {CODE-TABS}
  {CODE-TAB:php:Query indexing_related_documents_5@Indexes\IndexingRelatedDocuments.php /}
  {CODE-TAB-BLOCK:sql:RQL}
  // Get all authors that have books with title: "The Witcher"
from index "Authors/ByBooks"
where BookNames = "The Witcher"
  {CODE-TAB-BLOCK/}
  {CODE-TABS/}

### Tracking implications

* Indexing related data with tracking can be a useful way to query documents by their related data.  
  However, that may come with performance costs.

* **Re-indexing** will be triggered whenever any document in the collection that is referenced by `LoadDocument` is changed. 
  Even when indexing just a single field from the related document, any change to any other field will cause re-indexing. 
  (See changes that cause re-indexing [here](../indexes/indexing-related-documents#document-changes-that-cause-re-indexing)).

* Frequent re-indexing will increase CPU usage and reduce performance,  
  and index results may be stale for prolonged periods.

* Tracking indexed related data is more useful when the indexed related collection is known not to change much.

{PANEL: Index related documents - No tracking}

### Example III - no tracking

* **What is tracked**:  
   * Only the documents from the **indexed collection** are tracked for changes and can trigger re-indexing.  
     Any change done to any document in the **indexed related documents** will Not trigger re-indexing.  
     (See changes that cause re-indexing [here](../indexes/indexing-related-documents#document-changes-that-cause-re-indexing)).

* **The index**:  
  {CODE-TABS}
  {CODE-TAB:php:LINQ-index indexing_related_documents_6@Indexes\IndexingRelatedDocuments.php /}
  {CODE-TAB:php:JavaScript-index indexing_related_documents_6_JS@Indexes\IndexingRelatedDocuments.php /}
  {CODE-TABS/}

* **The query**:  
  When querying the index for Product documents by `CategoryName`,   
  results will be based on the related data that was **first indexed** when the index was deployed.  

     {CODE-TABS}
     {CODE-TAB:php:Query indexing_related_documents_7@Indexes\IndexingRelatedDocuments.php /}
     {CODE-TAB-BLOCK:sql:RQL}
     from index "Products/ByCategoryName/NoTracking"
where CategoryName == "Beverages"
     {CODE-TAB-BLOCK/}
     {CODE-TABS/}

---

{INFO: }
### No-tracking implications

* Indexing related data with no-tracking can be a useful way to query documents by their related data.  
  However, that may come with some data accuracy costs.

* **Re-indexing** will Not be triggered when documents in the collection that is referenced by `LoadDocument` are changed. 
  Although this may save system resources, the index entries and the indexed terms may not be updated with the current state of data.

* Indexing related data without tracking is useful when the indexed related data is fixed and not supposed to change.

{INFO/}

{PANEL/}

{PANEL: Document changes that cause re-indexing}

* The following changes done to a document will trigger re-indexing:  
   * Any modification to any document field (not just to the indexed fields)
   * Adding/Deleting an attachment
   * Creating a new Time series (modifying existing will not trigger)
   * Creating a new Counter (modifying existing will not trigger)

* Any such change done on any document in the **indexed collection** will trigger re-indexing.

* Any such change done on any document in the **indexed related documents** will trigger re-indexing  
  only if `NoTracking` was Not used in the index definition.
